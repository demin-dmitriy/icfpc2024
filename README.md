## Checklist for an event
- Check last year's report.
- Do not forget your goals (e.g. have fun).
- Write down current status of an event and your job before you leave (e.g. go to sleep).
- "Safe copy-paste rule": if you copy a code, make sure it was not copied before from some other code.
- The more reusable your code is going to be, the more assertions and verifications it required. Fast wheels with a drill would not go well next day if you rely on "common sense" right now. Anything can change in a really weird ways.
- If you have a task - tell others about it. It may be useful for others as well and it can become done while you are away (e.g. sleeping).
- Do not forget you are working in a team. If you handle large task alone, there is a chance it will not be over at all. Take your worst estimation of time it will take for you, multiply it by 2 - this is timepoint when the team will realize everything gone wrong. Do not be shy to delegate even simpliest task ("i need to replace 2 with -4 in all datasets"). Reliability of a system depends a lot on reliability of its most unreliable element. Time spent on discussions may be far more effective then writing a code alone.
- If you wrote a code - make sure it is used in a program. Otherwise, there is a chance it would not be used at all.
- "Tests" executable may be more powerful than anything else.
- Sometimes you do not commit directly to main brunch.
- Files are named `in_snake_case` so every OS can work with them without issues.
- Make sure you use Debug build when debugging and Release build when top performance is needed.
- If program runs slowly, check if build is Release.
- If program did not crash for a while, check if build is Debug.
